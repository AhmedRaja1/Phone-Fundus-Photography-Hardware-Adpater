Yes, you are absolutely right. It is to prevent a
 phenomenon called dazzle - the reflections from 
the inner surface of the tube. It falls right on 
the center of the lens as 2 semicircular reflexes. 
The Sandpaper acts like a baffle to reduce the 
reflections. The grains of sand prevent the 
reflection of the photons onto the lens.
